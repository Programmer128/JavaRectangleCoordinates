# JavaRectangleCoordinates
Creates a rectangle using point objects and compares grid location with other rectangles.

This program creates a rectangle in the Cartesian grid with 4 point objects representing its corners based on a center point, width, and height passed in as parameters. There is a method to determine if the rectangle overlaps with another rectangle object, and also whether a rectangle completely contains another rectangle.
